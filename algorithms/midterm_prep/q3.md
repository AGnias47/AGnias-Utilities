Extend the Weighted Interval Scheduling as following: each schedule can only include up to k out of total n jobs. The objective is still to find a compatible subset with the maximum total value.
1. (15 points) Provide a recursive solution in plain English first, followed by pseudo code and complexity analysis.
2. (5 points) Use the example in the class notes to illustrate your algorithm with a solution (i.e., selected jobs) for k = 2. The weight distribution from job a to job h is 2, 8, 7, 10, 3, 9, 13, and 11, respectively.

1.

sort jobs
select most max we can
until at_limit:
    see if we can drop 1 to add 2 at a lower cost.
