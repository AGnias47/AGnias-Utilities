Given n girls and 2n boys, each with her/his private preference orders,
1. (5 points) Design a girl-initiated extended G-S algorithm such that it is female-optimal.
2. (5 points) Briefly show that your algorithm is still stable.
3. (5 points) Suppose each girl can marry exactly two boys, define a new concept of stability.
4. (5 points) Design an extended G-S algorithm for 3. that terminates and all matches are stable.

```pseudocode
while free_girls:
    girl_propose_to_top_choice
    if boy is free:
        engage
        pop free girl
        pop free boy
    else:
        if boy prefes this girl:
            engage
            pop free girl
            pop free boy
            add broken up with girl
        else:
            pop top choice
            loop again
```

2. counterxample: girl prefers x and x is free
if x better than y, then x would be proposed to first
if x is free, x would automatically accept
x would not leave to be with no one
therefore, this form of unstable match will not occur

girl prefers x and x is paired but prefers girl
if x better than y, then x would be proposed to first
if x is in another match, will leave that match if prefers girl, which he does
therefore, x will leave and x and girl will pair, so this unstable match will not occur

3. If a girl can marry two boys, stability can be defined as

- girl prefers both boys she is with to all other boys
- if girl prefers another boy to one or both of her boys, the other boy would rather be with his current girl than with this girl
- boy prefers girl to all other girls
- if boy prefers other girl, other girl prefers her two boys to him

```pseudocode
double free_girls array via extension
create array of pointers for original free girls to location in preference list, starting at 0
while free_girls:
    girl propose starting with location in list
    if boy is free:
        engage
        pop free girl
        pop free boy
    else:
        if boy prefes this girl:
            engage
            pop free girl
            pop free boy
            add broken up with girl
        else:
            move pointer by 1
            loop again
```
